## Background
In assessment 1 I've made a new visualtisation desribing the top 26 languages most spoken languages in the world. I've Investigate the data inside this CSV file and thought about a possible outcome. After researching the graphs available on the web, i've picked the bubble graph. The reason i've picked this graph is because it is helpful to display the data to the user. In a visual way the size of the bubble is telling the amount of speakers of a language. 

## Data
The data comes from a CSV file. Inside the CSV file there are two columns (Languages and speakers). This CSV file has 54 fields.

## Features
